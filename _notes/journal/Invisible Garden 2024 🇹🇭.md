### Reflections on Invisible Garden#0

I recently joined [_Invisible Garden#0_](https://invisible.garden/), a zk hacker house hosted by the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.foundation/) at [4seas](https://x.com/4seasDeSoc). This experience has been transformative for my knowledge and personal growth.

#### Knowledge and Skills

• **Learning ZK in a Supportive Community:** Daily workshops covered zk, math foundations, and Solidity, with flexible sessions based on individual learning goals. I focused on math classes for foundational skills and attended basics in zk, which deepened my understanding and interest in these areas.

• **Hands-On Project Work:** Working with friends on a real-world project made learning zk practical. We created [_Privacy Visa_](https://github.com/invisible-garden/cm24-projects/tree/main/PrivacyVisa), a secure shopping solution that protects users’ card data.

#### Community

• **Diverse and Inspiring People:** The open-minded, dynamic environment has been a major source of motivation and inspiration. I’ve met people with diverse background—from moon explorer to barista—each bringing unique insights..

• **Chiang Mai Lifestyle:** Now I understand why Chiang Mai is a favorite for digital nomads. With mountains just 30 minutes away, street shops, world-class coffee, and a perfect balance of city life and nature, it’s the ideal environment for both relaxation and focus.

• **Memorable Adventures:** One of the highlights was a biking trip to Maerim, where we explored farms, biked to mountain tops, shared meals, and late-night conversation. This reminds me that there are many beautiful places on earth to explore.

#### Personal Growth Takeaways

• **Protecting Privacy:** I learned to minimize my personal information online. Setting boundaries and enhancing privacy helps to stay secure in the digital world.

• **Learning from Those with Experience:** Seeking advice from people with depth and breadth in the fields I’m interested in has been transformative. It clarified my goals, making them more achievable and meaningful.

• **Focusing on Skills Over Status:** I will keep remind myself to focus toward personal branding and skill-building over titles, organically.

• **Prioritizing Physical Health:** I am more productive after attending regular yoga classes—a great reminder that exercise is essential, even during intense learning periods.

• **Valuing Time:** Time is very very limited. You want to do something? Schedule it soon before you loose your motivation. Take ownership of your time.

I’m incredibly grateful for this journey and for being part of this knowledge-sharing community:)
