### Build your confidence factory

**Joy creates confidence.**
Confidence creates a sense of control.
A sense of control creates actions.

I recently signed up for a vocal class where my teacher recorded me singing the same song before and after class, incorporating his guidance. I could clearly see how much I have improved in tone. Moreover, I was surprised by how much it boosted my **overall confidence** to see myself improving, even for a joyful hobby like singing.

When we think of building _confidence_, we usually imagine achieving something big, which requires hard work. But it can actually come from achieving something small, something that doesn't feel like hard work because it's a joyful activity. Smaller and joyful goals are often more sustainable and accessible than larger ones.

So I thought, what if we can build this system?

If we can setup this system, I believe we can be _limitless_. But, the tricky part is to find something **joyful to do that boost your confidence.**

How it works?

- Joyful activities
  - Choose an _aspect of personal growth_ youâ€™re interested in building, where the process brings you joy (e.g. singing).
- Building confidence
  1. Set a small goal (e.g. sing a song using a new vocal technique I just learned).
  2. Achieve that goal.
  3. Positive feedback â€“ reward yourself a bit.

Good friends or coaches can boost this feedback loop with their encouragement and constructive feedback. Track and visualize your progress e.g. with apps, journals, or recordings.

I'm excited to improve my own confidence factory with joyfulness. Let's see how it goes! ðŸ˜Š
